    Simplified Routing:
    Simplified routing allows admins to select which queues will receive conversations for each touchpoint. Only agents belonging to at least one of these queues will receive the conversations in their inbox.
    
    Studio Flows:
    Studio flows provide more complex routing rules with manual or auto-acceptance options. With manual option, agents receive conversations similar to voice calls where they can accept or reject.
    
    Configuration:
    Queue routing can be configured through the admin panel by selecting touchpoints and assigning them to specific queues.
